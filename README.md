# TP SY33 - Automation and Industrial Computing Project

## Project Description

This project is carried out as part of the SY33 course. It includes an industrial automation simulation and detailed documentation. The main files of the project are:

- **dernière_version_tp_sy33.zef**: ZEF project file (used with specific automation software).
- **TP_SY33_NDOUR-TOUMBI(good version).factoryio**: Simulation file for Factory I/O, an industrial automation simulation software.
- **TP_SY33_TOUMBI_ANDRE_NDOUR_ALASSANE.pdf**: Detailed project report, including theoretical explanations, diagrams, and simulation results.

## Content

- `dernière_version_tp_sy33.zef`: This file contains the latest version of the project in ZEF format. It should be opened with the appropriate software to view and interact with the project.
- `TP_SY33_NDOUR-TOUMBI(good version).factoryio`: Factory I/O simulation file. It can be opened with Factory I/O to simulate and test automation scenarios.
- `TP_SY33_TOUMBI_ANDRE_NDOUR_ALASSANE.pdf`: Project report in PDF format. It provides a detailed explanation of the project, the methodologies used, the results obtained, and the conclusions.

## Prerequisites

To open and use the files in this project, you will need the following software:

- **[Factory I/O](https://factoryio.com/)**: To open and interact with the `.factoryio` file.
- **ZEF-compatible software**: To open the `.zef` file. (Ensure you have the compatible version of the software).

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Usamisann/Pick-Place.git
    ```

2. Open the PDF file to understand the context and details of the project.
3. Use Factory I/O to open the `TP_SY33_NDOUR-TOUMBI(good version).factoryio` file and run the simulation.
4. Use the ZEF-compatible software to open and examine `dernière_version_tp_sy33.zef`.
